							<h1>Part I</h1>		
							<p>The chapters of Part I work through the affordances, key terms, and limitations of three rhetorical functions of the visual that should feel familiar to any rhetorician and that resonate with widely taught and discussed understandings of rhetoric.</p>

							<p>These rhetorical functions of Part I—which we name pedagogical, catalytic, and communal—are among the rhetorical functions of the visual that have been most frequently, if implicitly, invoked in visual rhetoric scholarship to date. Our purpose in the chapters of Part I is to make each function explicit, assisting scholars and viewers in identifying its workings across contexts and illuminating what it reveals (and sometimes conceals) about the rhetoricity of the visual.</p>

						<h4>2. Catalytic Vision</h4>
							<p>which treats the visual as a means of sparking action and judgment or a locus for negotiating different interpretations of events in the public sphere.</p>
						<h4>3. Making Common Sight</h4>
							<p>which traces the role of the visual in drawing people together, building community, and creating boundaries of insider and outsider, us and them. </p>

							<p>Each chapter includes a case study to demonstrate its particular rhetorical function (religious stained glass, the photograph “Saigon Execution,” and electoral maps and their parodies). The underlying purpose of each chapter and its case study is to illuminate its attendant rhetorical function and demonstrate how one might take it up as a heuristic to make sense of other instantiations of that same function as well as distinguish similar but distinct functions.</p>
							
							<p>As we began to elaborate the rhetorical functions of the visual as a means of helping diversify visual rhetoric’s depth of field, we started with these three functions because we consistently found them at work within existing visual rhetoric scholarship.</p>
							<p>While the specific foci and theoretical commitments of that existing work has varied widely, we also found a fair amount of consistency at the meta level (what we might call its depth of field), in terms of how visual rhetoric scholars have imagined the nature and force of rhetoric itself. The rhetorical functions of pictures, images, and the visual as imagined in this scholarship have tended to live in the civic realm, have most often been matters of direct engagement (persuasion qua persuasion), and have typically imagined intention and agency on the part of both viewers and image-makers. They are, in other words (and as we have noted) relatively traditional rhetorical functions that resonate with the realms of public speech and writing out of which the Western study of rhetoric historically emerged. </p>
							<p>Visual rhetoric’s typical frames are enticingly resonant with the three traditional “branches” of rhetoric introduced by Greek rhetoricians, seemingly grown from long standing rhetorical interest in the art of making policy, adjudicating conflict, and sustaining civic life. While the first three functions are not precisely deliberative, forensic, and epideictic, they echo those traditional concerns. The pedagogical function of the visual treated in chapter one carries notes of deliberation; the catalytic force of the visual identified in chapter two is markedly forensic in how it has been taken up by visual rhetoricians; and the communal functions discussed in chapter three have a great deal in common with the rhetorical functions of the epideictic as understood by recent scholars. It is not surprising that the most commonly treated rhetorical functions of the visual would echo the traditional branches of rhetoric—they loom large in rhetorical studies in general (with deliberation and epideictic receiving the most attention).</p>
							<p>The three rhetorical functions of Part I belong together, however, not because of their shared presence in existing scholarship or their shared resonance with traditional rhetorical functions but because of the factors at the root of both that presence and resonance: an understanding of rhetoric and rhetoricity that is rooted in the public, focused on persuasive intent, and most frequently found in material, identifiable visual objects.</p><br><br>
