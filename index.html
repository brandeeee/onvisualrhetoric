							<p align="right"><em>A suburban scene, 2024. Kathleen Henning.</em></p>
							<p>We open this book about visual rhetoric with a photograph of a scene that is unlikely to quicken any rhetorical pulses. Nevertheless, it is rife with visual elements that rhetoricians have come to understand as deeply rhetorical. We start with this photograph because both what it shows and (eventually) how it was taken will help us make the case for a new way of doing—and looking at—visual rhetoric. More on that soon.</p>
							<p>For now, a starter question: where is visual rhetoric in this picture? </p><p>The photograph itself is serving a pedagogical and policy function for us as authors. We’re using it to guide viewers’ attention to specific salient elements, and it helps us frame the arguments we’ll make for reenvisioning the study of visual rhetoric. It teaches and leads.</p>
							<p>The photograph also invokes the visual’s ability to spark change. Looking closely, viewers will notice two yard signs in the center-left of the picture. On the right is a bright red sign with white lettering that reads “no rezoning.” Its design elements, echoing the ubiquitous form of the stop sign, indict a proposed policy change and, ironically, aim to get neighbors moving as part of a political campaign. To the left is a union organizing sign,  where the raised fist—long associated with collective action and Black power—has been subtly altered to match the shape of the state of Wisconsin. Each sign aims to catalyze change through visual activation. </p> 
							<p>The picture also captures elements of the environment that act rhetorically through vision. A curving, sidewalk-less street, a speed-limit sign, mailboxes, garbage and recycling bins, and copious grass and trees inform viewers’ sense of the sort of community they are about to enter. The partly obscured “Saukdale” sign, set between stone pillars, confirms that the photograph was taken in a suburban subdivision. Those attuned to regional differences in planning and plant life or to Indigenous history might, likewise, be able to use clues from the photographs to place the scene in the upper midwest. The photographs index location and community.</p>
							<p>These are three common places where rhetoricians have found rhetoric in the visual—its utility for supporting argument, its capacity to spark change, and its facility at community-making. These rhetorical aspects of the visual are all over the place—both in our everyday lives and in rhetorical scholarship. However, ubiquitous as they are (discoverable even in a somewhat random suburban scene!), these are not the only ways that the visual and the rhetorical come into contact. Two additional pictures help us picture three other sites of visual rhetoricity. These two new photographs show more-or-less the same scene as the opening photograph and are nearly identical to one another. They differ only in their depth of field—the amount of the photograph that is in focus, itself a rhetorical choice on the part of the photographer.</p>

							<p align="right"><em>Two views of a suburban scene, 2024. Kathleen Henning.</em> </p>
							<p>First, our choice to place these two new photos side-by-side—and to include technical information about aperture, shutter speed, lens length, and film speed—not only draws attention to the technologies that make any given picture possible but also to the human principles of selection and editing that work alongside them. Those technologies not only enable the rhetorical choices made by a given image-maker, they also carry the legacies of the earlier rhetorical choices that went into making the technologies themselves. The two pictures, differentiated only by shutter speed and aperture diameter, draw viewers’ eyes in different ways and make different elements of the scene seem to matter. Visual technology acts on and through viewers.</p>
							<p>Second, viewers’ own access to sight—and our assumption that those who encounter this book will use their eyes to read it—have rhetorical implications. Not only are these photographs full of signals that presume people navigate the world through sight, they also reflect back to us the actual limitations of sight. No viewer registers every pixel of these scenes and every viewer’s neurological processes engage pre-existing assumptions in order to meaningfully distinguish trees, grass, tools, and roads from the mass of stimuli that enter through their eyes. Physiologically, intellectually, and culturally, seeing includes shaping.</p>
							<p>And third, each viewer makes judgments—about where to focus, about the quality of the picture, about the importance of a particular element in the scene. In the process, viewers’ selections make certain elements matter. Those selections also elide other elements of what could be seen, setting them aside. This normal and necessary process nevertheless turns the act of looking into a constant flow of tiny rhetorical choices. What viewers notice and don’t notice affects their actions. </p>
							<p>These three photographs, then, are rich in elements that rhetoricians have often called “visual rhetoric.” They are also rich in features that are recognizably rhetorical but that have been less-commonly discussed by visual rhetoricians. In many ways, they encapsulate what has sometimes made “visual rhetoric” hard to define. When invoking “visual rhetoric,” rhetoricians have variously analyzed visual objects (pictorial instantiations of a “thing” called rhetoric); invoked methodology (an approach to rhetoric informed by the ubiquity of visual stimuli); engaged in theorizing (reconceptualizing rhetoric through vision); or identified themselves with a sub-field of rhetorical studies (a conglomerate of scholars with shared interest in things visual).</p>
							<p>The intersection of rhetoric and the visual draws our attention to objects like the signs and structures in our opening pictures (and also photographs, artwork, multimodal texts, etc.);<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> it includes images like the ideals of suburban design that inform the development captured in the photographs (as well as other intangible ideas, descriptions, and figures); <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>it includes visual technologies like the camera used to take the photograph (and also lenses, pigments and pixels, fiber optics, etc);<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> it includes the physical-cognitive act of seeing through which we processed the scene and photograph (and that involves retinas, optic nerves, brains, and more); <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>and it includes the social, cultural, and political worlds in which seeing practices emerge and function—including the ones that lead us—and the photographer we asked to take them—to describe these photographs as aesthetically unremarkable. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
							<p>Throughout this project, we approach “visual rhetoric” as encompassing all those elements. We also argue for a major shift in how rhetoricians think, write, and teach about vision and rhetoric.</p>

							<h2>Visual Rhetoric's Depth of Field</h2>
							<p>Visual rhetoric is a vibrant area of research because it offers and demands such a wide variety of approaches to what rhetoric is and how it functions. There is much that we can do when we set about studying what the visual does with us. And over the last several decades, rhetoricians have generated a capacious archive of objects and concepts for visual rhetoric—a wide-ranging catalog for the effects and affects of the visual which has established that the visual is, indeed, rhetorical; shown the importance of that rhetoricity; and provided robust means of engaging with particular aspects of the visual.</p>
							<p>For the most part, visual rhetoric—as a scholarly field—has been constituted by the case study. Encountering the great variety of the visual, scholars have illuminated it by turning our attention to particular historical moments, particular technologies, and particular kinds of images and visual objects. This approach has resulted in a broad array of rhetorical concepts and approaches for engaging the visual and many “rich rhetorical histories” that model what happens when rhetoricians take account of the visual.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> We might think about the visual rhetoric case study as a particular choice about depth of field, perhaps like the one used in the second of our three opening images. Its relatively wide aperture and fast shutter speed—and the resulting narrow depth of field—draws sharp attention to a bounded area in order to help viewers grasp the scene and its importance.</p>
							<p>Making wide use of the case study’s depth of field, visual rhetoric scholars have been less interested in elaborating relationships among the concepts and histories treated in those case studies or in elaborating overarching arguments about the shape or force of visual rhetoric (two other possible scholarly depths of field). In their foreword to a 2009 special issue of <i>enculturation</i> focused on image events, Kevin M. DeLuca and Joe Wilferth noted, “Although contemporary criticism reflects a certain agility with a variety of different visual artifacts … systematic rhetorical accounts of images are few.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>They sought an approach to images that recognized their “ontological status” and avoided taming images with words—whether those words came in the form of concepts drawn from textual analysis  or lent meaning through context. While we share DeLuca and Wilferth’s interest in systemic accounts, we are less faithful to images and their distinctions from texts and contexts. We are also less concerned with ontology and more concerned with relations and tools. We seek, in a phrase, not a “systemic rhetorical account of images” but a heuristic for engaging the rhetorical functions of the visual in their full range.</p>
							<p>As hinted at above, we find it helpful to introduce our heuristic purpose using the photographic concept of depth of field. Taken literally, depth of field names the amount of a photograph that is in focus, and it is measured in terms of the distance between the closest and the farthest objects that are in focus. Photographers and filmmakers use depth of field to direct attention and to create a sense of three-dimensionality. “Portrait mode” on an iPhone relies heavily on depth of field manipulations to make faces pop out of their surroundings, and many a bland amateur landscape photograph suffers from excessively wide depth of field that gives every object equal weight. </p>

							<p align="right"><em>Coneflowers photographs at different depths of field, 2024. Kathleen Henning.</em></p>
							<p>To compose this introduction, we asked Kathleen Henning, a local photographer, to take pictures in which she relied only on depth of field to highlight different elements of a scene. The trio of photographs above were among the results. Photo #2 has a shallow depth of field, leaving only the garden tools in focus. Photos #1 and #3 have significant depth of field, keeping nearly everything—near or far—in focus. There is a whole range of choices in between, with varying benefits and disadvantages to each choice and different sacrifices required to achieve any particular depth of field.</p>
							<p>There is no single correct choice for depth of field. The photographer’s purpose, equipment, and the larger environment all come into play when selecting aperture size—the primary determiner of depth of field in a photograph. In addition, photographers do not typically rely solely on choices about depth of field to craft their pictures (e.g. Henning described our charge as “a good exercise” but noted its artificiality). At the same time, a mismatch between purpose and depth of field can quickly lead to an unsuccessful picture. Most importantly, no photographer can fulfill all possible purposes while using one depth of field. Different situations call for different foci.</p>
							<p>Our heuristic for tracking the rhetorical functions of the visual is, essentially, a resource for making decisions about scholarly depth of field. It identifies the underlying factors driving rhetoricians’ analytical choices when engaging visual objects or processes, and it illuminates the structures that make particular choices of focus and theory work. It draws attention not only to what is in sharp focus but also to the shaping effects of that which is blurred or receding from focus.</p>
							<p>In effect, the digital book before you provides a tool for adding additional depths of field to our scholarly toolboxes and for understanding what different aperture settings reveal and obscure about the objects we study. In the photographs above and below, Henning has repeatedly captured purple coneflowers growing in a local prairie. Her choice of depth of field in each case—when combined with other technical choices—enable her to set individual flowers in evocative—but differing—context, crafting very different pictures in the process. She could have chosen a different aperture size in each case—and what viewers noticed about the scene would change as a result. We hope that this project’s heuristics are like that—offering means of calibrating rhetorical studies’ analytical capacities to engage the full depth of ways the visual and the rhetorical intersect.</p> 
							<p>Our first task in that heuristic project is to introduce a term that names that way of approaching visual rhetoric’s full depth of field. We ask you to change the focus of our field of study from “visual rhetoric” to “rhetorical functions of the visual.” Having made the case for that change, we then elaborate means for selecting scholarly depth of field when approaching the rhetorical functions of the visual: identifying the sort of visual functions being examined and recognizing how those functions shape the available theories, objects, contexts, and arguments. In developing this depth-of-field resource, we build on related work done by Cara Finnegan in multiple field-defining review essays <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>and by Olson, Finnegan, and Hope’s <i>Visual Rhetoric</i>. <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>Olson et. al. offer a framework of five “rhetorical actions” that highlight different aspects of visual rhetoricity. Our goal, in turn, is to provide a generative heuristic which allows students and scholars of the visual to draw connections among contexts, objects, and modes and to notice the consequences of those connections.</p>
							<p>Indeed, our own experience in developing this heuristic is that it quickly showed us surprising patterns in what visual rhetoricians have undertaken to date. Those patterns both revealed nodal points of significant social energy (Ralph Cintron would call them commonplaces<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>) and drew our attention to sites of omission, where the visual went but visual rhetoric scholarship typically did not. In this book, then, we also review our scholarly area’s own depth of field: surveying where visual rhetoric scholarship has focused, trying out other possible foci, and generating tools to enable future perspectives. </p>

							<h2>Rhetorical Functions of the Visual</h2><br>
							<p>The conceptual shift to “rhetorical functions of the visual” helps us challenge visual rhetoric’s over-association of visuality with objects (iconic photographs, awe-inspiring landscapes, compelling propaganda) and the related tendency to treat “rhetoric” itself as an object. In the last few decades, rhetorical studies as a whole has become less interested in traditional rhetorical objects and moved away from treating persuasion as a linear relationship consisting of senders, messages, and receivers. Today, most rhetorical scholars instead treat rhetoricity as ambient, ecological, and trophic.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> What it means to study rhetoric has shifted, decidedly, from studying objects deemed rhetorical (e.g. public speeches) to studying the contexts, movements, structures, and relationships within which objects and affects move and move others. </p>

							</div>
							<p align="right"><em>Coneflowers, honeybee, and bumblebees photographs at different depths of field, 2024. Kathleen Henning.</em></p>
							
						<p>Within the study of rhetoric and the visual, we mark that shift as a change from studying rhetoric that is visual to studying what vision and the visual do, rhetorically. Cara Finnegan called for this transition in 2004, inviting scholarship that “explicitly brings visuality to bear on rhetorical theory” and that highlights how “visuality affects, challenges, or changes our understanding of rhetoric.”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> While many rhetoricians have moved in that direction, “visual rhetoric” has still tended to mean the study of how visual objects persuade, just one aperture option among many possible depths of field. </p>
						<p>Rhetoricians engaging the visual need to push ourselves to use the full range of analytical apertures, however, if we are to accomplish the task Finnegan set for us two decades ago. Doing so will enable rhetoricians to better understand the immensely varied means by which vision encounters rhetoric and rhetoric infuses vision. The rhetorical functions of the visual—multiple, complex, and varied—are ubiquitous in our everyday lives just as they are in our opening photographs. The visual acts on us and through us in ways both explicit and implicit. We need means of making choices about our scholarly depth-of-field that will allow us to engage the visual’s full range. Thinking in terms of the rhetorical functions of the visual is a step in that direction because it orients us toward the multiplicity of choices rhetoricians have for capturing how vision and the visual are at work in the world.</p>
						<p>In order to support those varied choices about scholarly depth of field, we identify six rhetorical functions of the visual that include but exceed what scholars have most often studied as “visual rhetoric.”  In developing our heuristic and identifying rhetorical functions, we realized that, despite all the variety of the visual, visual rhetoric scholars have mostly hewed closely to just a couple rhetorical functions of the visual. We have done our work within frames provided by the conditions of Western democracy, by discourses of citizenship, and by presumptions of normative public engagement. These frames have offered a fairly narrow set of aperture choices and resulted in a similarly limited depth of field for visual rhetoric—one framed by the traditional proclivities of our larger discipline and by its theoretical and structural investments in whiteness, Westernness, and coloniality.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> We begin this project by identifying these traditional frames and elaborating both their affordances and  their shortcomings. In doing so, we also reveal the vast stretches of rhetorical functions that exceed, undergird, and surround them.</p>

							<h3>How to Read This Book</h3>
						</header>
						<div class="inner narrow">
							<h4>The structure</h4>
							<p>This book is organized in two parts, each with three chapters. Part I’s three chapters treat three familiar, more traditional rhetorical functions of the visual: the pedagogical, catalytic, and community building functions. Each one introduces a single function or set of functions and theorizes that function through a relevant example (we too rely on case studies, as it turns out). Each chapter also identifies some of the limitations that can arise if rhetoricians rely too exclusively on its rhetorical function, using a single depth of field to fulfill too wide a variety of purposes. The chapters of Part II introduce another three rhetorical functions of the visual that are equally crucial yet less frequently examined by rhetoricians: oversight, sight itself, and noticing. Here again, we introduce a single function in each chapter and theorize its affordances and constraints through discussion of a representative example.</p>
							<p>Together, the two parts and six chapters not only detail six common rhetorical functions of the visual, they also model the utility of orienting toward the visual in terms of its rhetorical functions. We invite future students of visual rhetoric to extend the heuristic, identifying new functions, reshaping those offered here, and showing what emerges when different functions interact with one another.</p>
							<p>Given those two parts and six chapters, readers have many possible entry points and routes through this book. You can read this book from beginning to end, starting here in the introduction and making your way through Part I (introduction, chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3) and Part II (introduction, chapter 4, chapter 5, chapter 6) before reaching the conclusion. We don’t expect many of you to do that, though. After all, even when we’re assigned to read a whole book, most of us read strategically. So, if you’re going to read strategically, allow us to give you some guidance as to what sorts of strategies can be helped by which ways of reading.</p>
							<h4><em>If you're looking to analyze something visual...</em></h4>
							<p>First, if you arrived at this book because you have something visual you want to analyze and you’re looking for guidance on how to approach it, we recommend that you start by reading this introduction and the introductions to each part (Part I intro, Part II intro). Reading those pieces will help you identify which rhetorical functions we elaborate  might be the closest fit with your project and purposes. </p>
							<em><h5>If you're new to visual rhetoric...</h5></em>
							<p>Second, if you’re new to visual rhetoric and wanting to learn about the field, we recommend starting with Part I and reading through all three chapters. Those chapters are a good starting place—they’re where visual rhetoric started, after all. They’ll help you build some of the basic critical tools that visual rhetoricians use. Also, we wrote our footnotes for readers like you—they provide a lot of context about the field of visual rhetoric that we couldn’t fit into the body paragraphs.</p>
							<h5><em>If you're familiar with visual rhetoric...</em></h5>
							<p>Third, if you’re already familiar with scholarship in visual rhetoric and you want to see what we’re adding to the conversation, you should obviously start with this introduction and the idea of the “rhetorical functions of the visual.” From there, if you want to see how that approach reframes familiar work in visual rhetoric, try out one of the chapters in Part I—chapter 1 if you’re interested in pedagogy and public spheres (or religious rhetoric and colonization); chapter 2 if you focus on social movements and powerful pictures; and chapter 3 if you’re most drawn to visual epideictic (or maps or AI). If you’d like to see us moving beyond visual objects as the center of visual rhetoricity, head to Part II. The chapter descriptions below and/or Part II introduction will help you decide which chapter to choose.</p>
							<h4>The design</h4>
							<p>This book is FILLED with pictures. No matter where you are in the book, you should never be more than a quick scroll away from an image other than text. That density is purposeful, and the pictures in this project are never mere illustrations—they aren’t just there to make the book look nice (though we do want the book to be beautiful as well as generative). At the same time, you won’t see us “reading” very many of the pictures as objects of analysis. We really only provide thick descriptions of visual objects once or twice in any given chapter. More often, the pictures serve as foils for thought or as fascinators meant to briefly but poignantly capture your attention. We hope that readers/viewers of the book will encounter those different uses of the pictures as different “aperture” choices, different depths of field by which you practice paying attention to the visual in a wide variety of ways. Close reading an image, the most common way that visual rhetoricians have made scholarly meaning from the visual, can yield a lot of information. Close readings also risk seeming to establish a single, certain rhetorical “thing” than the picture is doing and that ought to be transparent to all. Such clarity of meaning and effect rarely exists. And so, at various moments in this project, we ask you to encounter pictures as tools for triggering associations, providing contrast, or even simply giving your eyes a textual break. The pictures in On Visual Rhetoric will be doing all kinds of things—and we invite you to interact with them as you read, even when we don’t stop to tell you why or what to do with them.</p>
							<p>In the spirit of recognizing that viewers encounter pictures differently depending on context and purpose, we note that—for readers online—the pictures in this book are configured as responsive images. That web design choice means that there is no single version of this book that all reader/viewers will encounter. The cropping and spacing, in particular, will vary depending on the screen size of the device you are using. And that’s okay. It’s illustrative, even.</p>

Visual technologies of racialization take central stage in this chapter, focused through the lens of Polaroid’s ID-2 camera, its role in apartheid South Africa, and a boycott led by the Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement. </p>

										<h3>Sight Itself</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Visual rhetoric has typically looked at things seen, not the act of seeing. But rhetoricians must follow neural pulses through bodies if we hope to understand the force of the visual. When we omit sight’s embodied nature, we miss a great deal of what makes vision rhetorical. What lookers see, how they see, and what they do with sight all create the “rhetorics” of sight. Sight is about bodies as complex, situated, racialized, and visceral. It is also about bodies as habituated and trained. The chapter weaves together psychological work on implicit bias and physiological study of human visual processes to treat the fleshy matters of vision as profoundly, thoroughly, and generatively rhetorical.</p>

										<h3>Noticing &amp; Mattering</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Noticing (and not noticing) happen subtly yet they have significant effects. Naming “noticing” as a rhetorical function helps us identify visual rhetorics of acquiescence and normalcy that are ubiquitous even if hard to track. Once again engaging scholarship on the psychology of sight, this chapter highlights the complexity of attention as a visual function in order to complicate rhetorical studies’ long-standing emphasis on importance and magnitude. Using the rhetorical problem of picturing climate change as our foil, we demonstrate what visual rhetoricians gain by attending to that which audiences fail to notice.</p>
